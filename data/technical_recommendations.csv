Check to identify any local regulations concerning [earthquake] hazard. ,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,4,2,,,,,
"Consider the effect that volcanic hazards near to the volcano – volcanic ballistics, lava flows, lahars and pyroclastic flows – could have on the planned project. If the project is located with 100 km of a volcano, planning should consider the effect of mud-flows in valleys and close to river channels, and debris flows in all areas. Further information should be gained from local volcanic hazard maps (if they exist).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,
"Engage with a qualified local or international [expert], to understand [name of] risk to your project, and to improve the resilience of project to [name of] risks. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If the project is in a hazardous zone, collect more specific flood hazard information about the exact project location. This could start by, e.g., performing a more in-depth flood hazard assessment in the area with more detailed models that include local protection levels. In addition, investigate if local flood protection measures are in place. Locating your project behind flood protections measures may considerably reduce the flood hazard.",,,,,4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consider the relocation of your project to an area with a lower hazard level.,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the case of classification of the asset as critical infrastructure, investigate the cascading effect of possible vulnerable network dependencies of the asset (e.g. power supply and computer and communication networks) that may lead to failure of the functions of the asset, even if the asset itself is not flooded. Also ensure the accessibility of the asset during a flood, e.g. by raising access roads.",,,,,7,5,3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ensure that the project obeys existing (if any) flood zoning regulations.,,,,,2,2,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If national structural design guidelines do not exist, wind speeds for safe design should be obtained from guidance available for other countries in the region or international guidelines (see links below).",,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Identify whether local cyclone evacuation plans and shelters are in place in your project region. If applicable, check with local authorities if the existing evacuation capacity (e.g. schools, religious buildings, or comparable) will be sufficient after implementing your project. Otherwise, consider installing shelters within your project. Evaluate whether the shelter can be used for people in the surrounding area too. ",,,,,,,,,6,5,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review historical events and reported losses in the area of your project (see links below). These can give valuable information on the suitability of a chosen location and how prone this location is to cyclones.,,,,,,,,,2,2,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consider an alternative site for your project which is less susceptible to cyclones. Locations close to the coast and outside built environment are generally more susceptible than inland sites and urbanized areas with multi-storey buildings. ,,,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If your project is in coastal areas, you are strongly advised to also investigate the related storm surge hazard using this tool, and follow the guidance given for storm surges.",,,,,,,,,8,6,4,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Enquire for any alert or ealy warning system, and consider taking it  into account into an evacuation plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Droughts occur very often in your project location and may affect every day life of your employees and stakeholders. Investigate the resilience of your employees and beneficiaries to droughts and drought-related problems such as food security and failing crops. Take measures - if necessary - to increase their resilience or the resilience of specific, more vulnerable groups (i.e. women, minorities, handicapped groups etc.). This can be done through providing good work conditions for employees (which might for example include improved access to health care) or by including it in project design (for example by providing meals at events, providing access to microcredits, setting up community assets and co-operations).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,
When making a project budget take into account any necessary measures to prevent droughts from affecting your project. Also set aside finances to cover unforeseen costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,

Be familiar with and comply to any policies and regulations with respect to drought reduction and drought response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,,
Take insurances (also consider fire risk and crop failure) where possible and be aware which institutes will provide relief in case of true humanitarian catastrophes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,
"Consider the long-term duration of your project and of built assets and infrastructure. Are they supposed to last 20 to 50 years, or even longer? If that is the case, they will be exposed to a serious drought event, which might affect continuation of attained project results. Take measures so that future employees or stakeholders can maintain infrastructure and prevent droughts from undoing any attained project results even after the project was finished. This might include training, installing good governance,  setting up mechanisms to raise money for insurances or buying of seeds for a new crop season",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,
Check local/indigineous strategies for coping with droughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consider the effect that a drought event might have on the local population, your employees and beneficiaries. How would they respond to a drought, how would they be affected and is there sufficient resilience so as not to hamper the project in the event of a drought?  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,

"Obtain and comply to any fire risk regulations, especially with respect to planning and construction. Have evacuation plans ready and make sure safety regulations are met.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,5,
"Review historical drought events and reported damages due to drought in the area of your project. Talk to local people as well as elderly people and ask them about any drought events they remember or that they have been told of and what the impact was of that event. This can indicate whether droughts are truly non-existing and if not, what kind of impact can be expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
 Identify if any local regulations exist concerning droughts. This may refer to limits on water use and electricity cuts in the event of droughts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,2
