EQ,HIG,"In the area you have selected (name of location) earthquake hazard is classified as **high** according to the information that is currently available. This means that there is more than a 20% chance of potentially-damaging earthquake shaking in your project area in the next 50 years. Based on this information, the impact of earthquake **must be considered** in all phases of the project, in particular during design and construction. **Project planning decisions, project design, and construction methods should take into account the level of earthquake hazard**. Further detailed information should be obtained to adequately account for the level of hazard."
EQ,MED,"In the area you have selected (name of location) earthquake hazard is classified as **medium** according to the information that is currently available. This means that there is between a 10% and 20% chance of potentially-damaging earthquake shaking in your project area in the next 50 years. Based on this information, the impact of earthquake **should be considered** in all phases of the project, in particular during design and construction. **Project planning decisions, project design, and construction methods should take into account the level of earthquake hazard**. Further detailed information should be obtained to adequately account for the level of hazard."

FL,HIG,"In the area you have selected (name of location) river flood hazard is classified as **high** according to the information that is currently available to this tool. This means that there is a chance of more than 10% that potentially damaging and life-threatening floods occur in the coming 10 years. **Project planning decisions, project design, and construction methods must take into account the level flood hazard**. The following is a list of recommendations that could be followed in different phases of the project to help reduce the risk to your project. Please note that these recommendations are generic and not project-specific."
FL,MED,"In the area you have selected (name of location) river flood hazard is classified as **medium** according to the information that is currently available to this tool. This means that there is a chance of more than 5% that potentially damaging and life-threatening floods occur in the coming 10 years. **Project planning decisions, project design, and construction methods must take into account the level flood hazard**. The following is a list of recommendations that could be followed in different phases of the project to help reduce the risk to your project. Please note that these recommendations are generic and not project-specific."
FL,LOW,"In the area you have selected (name of location) river flood hazard is classified as **low** according to the information that is currently available to this tool. This means that there is a chance of more than 10% that potentially damaging and life-threatening floods occur in the coming 100 years. **Project planning decisions, project design, and construction methods should take into account the level flood hazard**. The following is a list of recommendations that could be followed in different phases of the project to help reduce the risk to your project. Please note that these recommendations are generic and not project-specific."
FL,VLO,"In the area you have selected (name of location) there is no evidence of river flood hazard according to the information that is currently available to this tool. This means that there is a chance of less than 10% that potentially damaging and life-threatening floods occur in the coming 100 years. Therefore, based on this information, **flood hazard does not need to be explicitly considered for your project**. Although the hazard is considered to be very low or non-existent in the project location based on the information available in Think Hazard!, additional information may show some level of hazard. If local or additional information sources suggest that there is flood hazard, follow the recommendations below and seek expert guidance on additional recommended actions. It is recommended that local flood regulations and conditions possibly leading to highly localized water nuisance problems are considered. In particular, it is recommended to check the condition of and possible flaws in local water management systems, e.g. poorly dimensioned or maintained sewerage or drainage channels. Always consider taking no-regret measures."

This means that the selected area is located at less than 50 km from a volcano for which a potentially damaging eruption has been recorded in the past 2,000 years and that future damaging eruptions are possible. Based on this information, **the impact of volcanic eruption must be considered in all phases of the project, in particular during project design, implementation and maintenance**. Further detailed information should be obtained to adequately account for the level of risk posed by individual volcanoes."
