          gettext('How does *ThinkHazard!* work?'),
          gettext('*ThinkHazard!* uses the best available hazard data as the basis of its classification of hazard level. One method uses probabilistic data, which specifies the intensity and frequency of events in each region – e.g., earthquake data show the likelihood of a particular amount of ground shaking occurring at different locations. *ThinkHazard!* also uses data that says, for example, ‘the climate and ground conditions in this region suggest the region has a certain susceptibility to landslides’.

The classification of hazard level in *ThinkHazard!* is based on the likelihood of each region experiencing a hazard with enough intensity (e.g., intensity of ground shaking) to cause damage. A higher hazard classification in *ThinkHazard!* indicates that there is greater potential for damage or disruption to activities or a project in that region, according to the underlying hazard data.

For any region selected by a user, *ThinkHazard!* shows the maximum hazard level within that region. In the example below, earthquake hazard in the district ‘Ladislao Cabrera’ is rated ‘Medium’ based on underlying hazard data, but some of its neighboring districts are rated ‘Low’ (left image). The parent region, ‘Oruro’ Departmento (right image), is assigned the maximum hazard level of all districts it contains, so it is also assigned ‘Medium’. Bolivia contains nine Departmentos, which have different hazard levels, but as maximum hazard in ‘Medium’, Bolivia is assigned ‘Medium’. This example demonstrates the need to drill down to the region(s) relevant to your project, to find out more about the distribution of hazard there.') +

The fact that an event occurred recently does not necessarily change the average frequency in the long-term.

Similarly, the hazard level may be considered high, even if there has not been an event in living memory. Some hazards may only occur years or decades apart in some regions, but are classified as high hazard when looking at longer timescales. These are known as ‘low frequency hazards’, and include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.')

The larger the return period for an event, the less likely its occurrence, and the greater its intensity. Return period, expresses the average time between hazard events of a particular severity, or intensity.

It is important to recognize that these numbers are **averages**. When an event is referred to as having a ‘1 in 100-year return period’, it means that **on average**, an event that size or bigger would be expected to occur once in a 100-year period. **However**, another event of that size or bigger could practically occur in the next day, or year, or in another 50 years. Or, one that size may not occur again for more than 100 years. Remember, these are statistical averages.

An equivalent way of expressing return period is as the chance of occurring each year. A ‘1 in 100-year return period’ also means a 1&#37; chance of occurring in any single year. A more frequent event, say one with ‘1 in 20-year return period’ has a 5&#37; chance of occurring in any single year (1/20 = 0.05, or 5&#37;).')

First, we set intensity thresholds (using original intensity units), above which the intensity is damaging (not specific to any particular infrastructure or environment).

In some cases, we set a higher threshold for ‘High’ hazard level, than for lower levels, to differentiate the level of damage. We then consider whether the threshold is exceeded at three return periods, which differs for each hazard, reflecting the different frequency of events. If the intensity threshold is exceeded at the most frequent return period, the hazard is determined to be ‘High’. If the threshold is exceeded at the intermediate return period but not the most frequent, it is determined to be ‘Medium’. If the threshold is exceeded at the least frequent return period only, the hazard is determined to be ‘Low’. If there is hazard data present but the threshold is not exceeded at any return period, hazard is determined to be ‘Very Low’.

For non-probabilistic data, such as landslide susceptibility index, we categorize the index into hazard levels using the original data values. The maximum hazard level in each administrative unit 2 (based on the FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers dataset) is deemed to be the hazard level of that unit. The hazard level of a state or province boundary is the maximum hazard level of all districts that it contains.

If areas of permanent water were included in the calculation, almost all administrative areas would have ‘High’ hazard. We use the return period layers in place of a global water body mask, because a global mask layer was found to not effectively exclude small rivers.
